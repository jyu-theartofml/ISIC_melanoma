# ISIC_melanoma

This is the repo for blog post <a href='http://yinniyu.github.io/posts/melanoma'>Binary Classifier for Melanoma Using MobileNet</a>. Instead of the previous MobileNet model, DenseNet had better performance and is more robust. The Keras model runs on Tensorflow backend, and the AMI used was Bitfusion Ubuntu 14 TensorFlow with instance type of g2.2xlarge. 

## Training the model
The general workflow is as follows: segmentation of original image(segmentation_01_preprocessing.py, segmentation_02_segnet_train.py) --> mask image(image_mask_array.py) --> train model on masked images(densenet_train.py).

<i>Note: This repo is still a work-in-progress, more information/graphics will be added later. </i>
